general info:
	- a lab to do at every class

operating systems:
	- goal is to know how OS operate.
	- a computer is composed of it's hardware (cpu, gpu, ram, rom...) and to use it efficiently --> OS
	- we're gonna study how the OS manages the resources, in the form of 4 parts:
		- process management
		- volatile memory management
		- hard memory management --> file systems
		- I/O managing
	- next we'll learn practical things:
		- system calls
		- system programming

Process management:
	- definitions:
		- program/executable: in an executable you'll find the code, the GLOBAL & CONSTANT data, 
		- process --> instance of a program that is currently executed
